# A repository with all practical exercises from learnweb3.io

Hello, im frenzoid, i want to also mention that some of the configurations are imported differently, mainly because theres a better way of doing this than the one mentioned in the tutorials. Also i **HEAVILY** suggest to add a new field on your abis called "address" with the contract's address, since this makes things more easy to manage ( Check constant files / config folders on frontends on sophomore ).

Best regards, and good luck!
